# TheArtOfPour-API
Python3 based API using eve-sqlalchemy and tensorflow

Thank you to everyone who attended my talk at this year's HomebrewCon.

I'll be working over the next few days on getting any remaining code/data deployed, as well as setting licenses and documentation.

Cheers!

Installing eve-sqlalchemy: **pip install eve-sqlalchemy**
Installing tensorflow: **pip install tensorflow**

Starting the API: **python app.py**
```
[CondaEnv] PS C:\TheArtOfPour\TheArtOfPour-API> python .\app.py
